This is the repository for COMP5426 Parallel and Distributed Computing in USYD

using Makefile to run the code:
- Compile: run "mingw32-make".
- Run task 1: run "mpiexec -n 4 assignment2\_1.exe 1024 4".
- Run task 2: run "mpiexec -n 4 assignment2\_2.exe 1024".

**Attention!** you may need to edit the makefile to use the correct path for MPI.
